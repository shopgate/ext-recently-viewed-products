# Shopgate Connect - Extension Recently-Viewed-Products

This extension provides a slider of the recently viewed products within the cart.

The amount of items within the slider is limited and will only show up the recent entries. When a cms page with the key `recently-viewed` is available within the `quicklinks` menu, the complete list can be shown within that page.
